# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The application uses Bootstrap CSS styles and JavaScript to dynamically render a 5-day weather forecast for a city entered by the user. Each day of the 5-day forecast is displayed on a dynamically rendered card. The user's searches are saved in localStorage and dynamically rendered to a new button that can be clicked to search and display the city's data again. The application uses a third-party API, openweathermap.org, to provide current and forecasted weather data. 
By relying on Bootstrap to do most of the styling, I was able to save a lot of time and focus on working with the API data and re-working my JavaScript logic. This was the first project where I used a CSS framework to provide most of the styles, and I found it to be very helpful and convenient to work with. Most of my time was spent re-working my JavaScript logic after I had already obtained the api fetch data. Given the time frame for this project, I am mostly pleased with the result. 
One unexpected challenge during this project was dealing with an api key while committing code to a public repository. I received a security alert from Github after my first commit that included the working API key, which caused me to delete the repository and work locally for most of the project. After learning more about the security of API keys and how I was using them to access data, I realized it was safe to commit with the key for this project because it was a free account without access to any sensitive information.  

## Usage
The application is intented to be run in a browser.
